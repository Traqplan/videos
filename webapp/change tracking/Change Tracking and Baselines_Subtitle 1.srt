01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:04,083
<b>So in this video, we're going to look at</b>

2
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,083
<b>how we change plans,</b>

3
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,000
<b>how we track changes across them,</b>

4
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,833
<b>how traqplan is really just</b>

5
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,833
<b>amazing at showing the changes</b>

6
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,166
<b>between projects from one</b>

7
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:14,666
<b>reporting period to the next.</b>

8
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,541
<b> if we expand a simple event plan,</b>

9
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,583
<b>we can see more than</b>

10
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:19,625
<b>one version in that plan.</b>

11
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:20,750
<b>Right now, we're gonna</b>

12
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,791
<b>make some changes to it</b>

13
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:22,500
<b>and watch what happens</b>

14
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,541
<b>as we make those changes.</b>

15
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:27,500
<b>Here, we will move the venue.</b>

16
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,875
<b>So we shall pull up back</b>

17
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,833
<b>to the left a little bit.</b>

18
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:33,166
<b>And for some others, we</b>

19
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:34,041
<b>think that the infrastructure</b>

20
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:35,875
<b>is going to take a little bit longer.</b>

21
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,583
<b>So let's move that to the right.</b>

22
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,250
<b>And you can see if we</b>

23
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,458
<b>flip between those two [versions] ,</b>

24
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:43,666
<b>the venue is moving.</b>

25
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:45,791
<b>And also, the</b>

26
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,791
<b>infrastructure change we've just made</b>

27
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,208
<b>is also really clearly shown.</b>

28
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,166
<b>But there's a better</b>

29
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:56,583
<b>way to actually show these</b>

30
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,416
<b>without having to flip</b>

31
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,625
<b>between one view and another.</b>

32
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:00,875
<b>And that is simply to</b>

33
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,875
<b>make the older version</b>

34
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,125
<b>a comparison baseline.</b>

35
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,416
<b>And once we do that, you</b>

36
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,375
<b>can see that what has appeared</b>

37
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,291
<b>is a green line showing</b>

38
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:14,125
<b>that venue has got better [ie. happening sooner than it was before]</b>

39
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,000
<b>in the most recent</b>

40
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,125
<b>version, and some red lines</b>

41
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:19,041
<b>showing that the infrastructure project</b>

42
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,541
<b>has slipped a little bit.</b>

43
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,583
<b>That is by far the cleanest</b>

44
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,833
<b> way of showing changes</b>

45
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,625
<b>between one view and another.</b>

46
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,083
<b>And this is really important,</b>

47
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:30,916
<b>because the first time you show Traqplan</b>

48
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:31,833
<b>to your bosses,</b>

49
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,125
<b>they're gonna love it.</b>

50
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:34,875
<b>But the second month you show them,</b>

51
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:35,875
<b>they're gonna say it still looks great,</b>

52
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:36,833
<b>they're gonna say it still looks great,</b>

53
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:37,875
<b>but what's changed?</b>

54
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,666
<b>and this works for Microsoft project</b>

55
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:43,750
<b>imports, it'll soon work for Primavera P6</b>

56
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,541
