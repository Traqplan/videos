 creating a new project plan in traqplan is easy! :)
just click in the new button
you can either import from project or create a new one
we will go for my first project
put it into the program...
...let's call it 'Demos' and click 'Create project'
you will have three activities created by default
one is a milestone and two of them are tasks
it's as simple as that!  (Have fun! :)
